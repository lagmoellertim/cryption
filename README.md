## Introduction

Cryption is an **open-source tool** that **encrypts and decrypts** your data in the browser.

It does **not** upload data to any **cloud**.

It checks the **file integrity**, making it **impossible to manipulate data** without the correct password.

You can also **give hints** in order to  remeber your **password**.

If you want to,  you could download Cryption and use it fully functional **offline on your computer**.

### Usage

### Usage Information

To use Cryption as it was intentioned, I advice you to use **Firefox**. Both Chrome and Safari will crash when files get big (>25 MB), while Firefox managed to encrypt and decrypt files larger then 100 MB. It was also the fastest, but nonetheless, every browser **should** work

If you want to upload a directory, consider **zipping** it before uploading, since JavaScript cannot handle directory uploads. You can, however, upload multiple files, which Cryption then **bundles** to a zip-archive automatically.


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 10
- npm >= 5

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository (stable branch)
git clone -b master https://github.com/lagmoellertim/cryption.git cryption

#Change Directory
cd cryption

# Install npm packages
npm install

# Start a local server
npm start
```

### Build

```sh
# Clone the repository (stable branch)
git clone -b master https://github.com/lagmoellertim/cryption.git cryption

#Change Directory
cd cryption

npm run-script build
```

### Use on local machine without internet

Download the latest build.zip file from the [Cryption releases](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/cryption/releases/latest).

After unzipping it, you can just open the index.html file with your browser, no need to put it on a server!
